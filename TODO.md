# Lists

-   [x] Upload form
-   [x] Edit form
-   [x] Ampersand in game name is breaking URL (probably just wrap game names in `encodeURIComponent()`)
-   [x] Metadata for embeds
-   Triple check iframe security stuff
-   Comparisons

# User

-   [x] Generating/deleting API tokens
-   2FA

# General

-   Content security policy for the frontend itself.
-   Double check cache control and other related things for perf/etc

# API

-   [x] Need to move over the scheduled tasks for deleting expired lists and orphaned files from existing phinocio/loadorderlibrary repo.
-   [ ] Complete review of token permissions on API (half done)
-   [x] Move APIToken stuff to a specific API Token controller

# TO FIX:

-   Text reflow issues on thinner mobile devices
-   [x] No logo for non-list-specific embeds
-   Verison and game name need to be split onto different lines in list view
